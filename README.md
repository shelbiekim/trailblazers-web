## Project overview
“Eat healthy, live better” is a web application which is designed for young Australian adults (ages 18-25 years) to reduce their personal carbon footprints through food choices. The idea of the project is to slow down global warming by improving the awareness of young Australian adults. Food production takes up a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. By calculating the daily meal’s carbon footprint and selecting carbon-deficient recipes, users can make a difference in the environment while developing good health. 

Australia is known to be the second-largest per capita consumption of meat and dairy in the world. Although there are young adults across Australia who want to expand their knowledge around the food carbon footprint and develop nutritious eating habits, they are facing difficulties in finding integrated information.
